# Minimis

A theme I wrote to work on my Nvidia Shield

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/waldnercharles/Minimis/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract the theme to your [theme directory](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes). You can then select it in the settings menu of Pegasus.
